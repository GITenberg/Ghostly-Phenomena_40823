description: Throughout his life, Irish-born writer Elliot O'Donnell reportedly experienced
  several encounters with ghostly beings, including one run-in with a spirit in Dublin
  that almost proved fatal. Inspired by these experiences, O'Donnell devoted his life
  to hunting and documenting specters. The collection Ghostly Phenomena brings together
  an impressive batch of ghost-related folktales, sightings, and anecdotes.
